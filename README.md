# Coffee-Shop-Daily-Revenue-Analysis-


Coffee shops serve more than just great coffee—they generate valuable data! In my latest project, I analyzed daily revenue patterns to understand what drives sales and how businesses can optimize operations for better profitability.

🔎 Key Steps in the Analysis:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends using histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
✅ Feature Engineering: Examined customer behavior, order values, marketing spend, and foot traffic.
✅ Predictive Modeling: Built a Random Forest Regressor to forecast daily revenue, achieving an impressive R² score of 0.949!
✅ Insights & Recommendations:

📈 High foot traffic and marketing spend positively impact revenue.
⏳ Operating hours and customer volume play crucial roles in daily earnings.

🔍 Future work includes time-series forecasting & real-time prediction models.

💡 This project highlights how data-driven decision-making can help businesses optimize pricing, staffing, and marketing strategies. If you’re interested in AI-powered business insights, let’s connect! 🚀
